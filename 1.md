How's everybody doing today?
大家好！

So for those of you who may not know who I am, which is probably the vast majority of you all.
大家可能不太认识我， 可能在座的绝大多数人都是这样。

My name is Cordae. I'm 24 years old. I was born in Raleigh, North Carolina. but was raised majority in Suitland, Maryland, which made me who I am today. I'm a hip-hop artist. More specifically, a Grammy-nominated hip-hop artist.
我叫Cordae， 今年 24 岁。 我出生于北卡罗来纳州 罗利市（Raleigh）。 不过，我基本上在马里兰州 苏特兰（Suitland）长大， 在那里的生活 让我取得了今天的成就。 我是一名说唱歌手。 更具体地说， 一名获得格莱美提名的说唱歌手。

A quote unquote critically acclaimed, world-renowned B-list celebrity.
就是所谓的“深受好评、 享誉世界“的二线明星。

But to be honest, more like B minus. But again, you all can just call me Cordae and assume that I'm almost kind of a big deal because I am here doing a TED Talk.
但老实说，应该比二线强一点点了。 不过，大家只要 叫我Cordae就行了， 并默认我是某个大人物， 因为毕竟我是来TED演讲的嘛

Now I know what you're thinking. What does a 24-year-old rapper possibly have to say during a TED Talk? Like, who cares what Ja Rule thinks, you know? But I'm here to talk about my mantra and my way of life that has gotten me this far and can hopefully take me a lot further on my journey, as I'm just getting started. And that’s the “Hi Level mindset.”
我知道大家是怎么想的。 一个才 24 岁的说唱歌手， 在TED演讲上有什么好说的呢？ 或者，谁会关心杰·鲁 （Ja Rule）怎么想呢？ 不过，我来这里向大家介绍 我奉行的准则， 以及我的生活方式， 它们帮助我获得了成功， 并有望引领我取得更大的成就， 因为我的旅途才刚刚开始。 它就是“高水准思维” （Hi Level mindset）。

Now before I get into the details about the Hi Level mindset, I want to tell you about the original creator of the Hi Level mindset. And that's my mom. She doesn't even know it. My mom had me when she was 16 years old. She was a single mom with all the odds stacked against her. And yet, from an unbiased perspective, I like to say she did a pretty decent job. We lived in some pretty terrible neighborhoods, man. I switched elementary schools about five different times. I remember one time her car had got stolen twice in one week. She overcame circumstance, obstacles, her environment and negativity. As I watched, our living situations would continue to get better and better as the years went by. Now that's Hi Level.
现在， 在详细说明 高水准思维之前， 我想向大家介绍 高水准思维的原创者。 她就是我妈妈。 她甚至都不知道这一点。 我妈妈生下我时，她 16 岁。 她是位单亲妈妈，历经苦难。 但是，不带偏见地说， 我想说，她是位伟大的母亲。 我们生活的街区情况非常糟糕。 读小学时，我就换了 五所不同的学校。 我记得有一次， 她的汽车在一周内被偷了两次。 她克服了各种窘境、阻碍、 恶劣环境和负面影响。 我注意到，这些年来， 我们的生存环境在不断改善。 现在来说说高水准思维。

Now the Hi Level mindset wasn’t something that she directly taught me or purposefully instilled in me, but something I learned simply by observation. The Hi Level mindset is a philosophy. It’s a wavelength to apply to your everyday thoughts and regiment. The Hi Level mindset will be of great service to you, especially when things aren't going as planned. These trying times that I speak of, or life testers, if you may, are what truly make us man and woman. Actually scratch that. How we handle these lifetimes, these trying times, or life testers, is what decides a person's destiny.
高水准思维 不是她直接教给我， 也不是她有意灌输给我的东西， 而是我通过观察学到的内容。 高水准思维是一种哲学。 这种思维适用于 大家的日常思考和活动。 高水准思维 将会给大家带来巨大帮助， 在出现意外的情况下尤其如此。 我提到的那些困难时刻， 或生活的考验， 让我们成为了真正的人。 算了，我换一种说法。 我们如何过完这一生， 如何克服困难， 或面对生活的考验， 将决定我们个人的命运。

Which brings me to step one of the Hi Level mindset. And that's always remain positive, no matter what people or life may throw at you. Now I'm going to give you a little bit of background about myself. Funny enough, I was actually voted most likely to be famous in both middle school and high school. Now I know what you're thinking. I'm sorry. I haven't always been this good looking, it takes a little bit of time.
这就引出了高水准思维的第一步。 也就是，不管他人 或生活如何折磨你， 都要始终保持积极乐观。 现在，我向大家 简单介绍一下我自己。 实际上，搞笑的是， 在初中和高中的时候， 人们就投票认为 我最有可能会出名。 我知道大家在想什么。不好意思。 我不是一直这么帅， 做出改变花了我一段时间。

My goal was to graduate high school and to immediately blow up. But that didn't happen. So I went to college and as soon as I went to college, boy, did life hit me hard. Within the first couple of weeks of school, one of my best friends that I called my brother had gotten sentenced to 24 years in prison. I had gotten detained for driving with a suspended license, amongst other things, like having a pound of weed in the car before it was legal. And my grandmother had passed. Not to mention I was already a terrible student with horrific grades and a broke teenager. And I wonder why my grades were so bad. Now that's just disrespectful. I wasn't even trying to hide it. But on top of all of these things, what was really the breaking point for me was that I had released a mixtape that I worked on the entire summer and it had only gotten 200 downloads. Now my previous two mixtapes got 2,000 downloads, so I was not happy with the regression, to say the least. Again, this almost pushed me to the brink of quitting and insanity. But the Hi Level mindset made me think, "Man. These misfortunes are just going to make my triumph story a lot cooler."
那时，我的目标是高中毕业， 然后立即去混社会。 但并没有发生那种情况。 相反，我上了大学。 不过，我一到大学， 就受到了生活的暴击。 在到校的前几周内， 我的一个与我称兄道弟的好朋友 就被判处 24 年监禁。 我曾因使用 被吊销的驾照而被拘留， 还有其他事情， 比如在大麻合法之前， 在车里带了一磅大麻。 期间我的祖母去世了。 不用说，我已经是一个差生， 不但成绩糟糕， 而且身无分文。 我也不知道， 为什么我的成绩会那么差。 既然已经那样了， 我也就破罐子破摔了。 但除了所有这些事情， 真正让我崩溃的是， 我花了整个夏天 制作的一盘混音磁带， 下载量却只有 200 次。 如今，我的前两盘混音磁带 有 2000 次下载， 至少可以这样说， 我对那个数量很不满意。 再一次，这几乎将我推向 退学和精神失常的边缘。 但是，高水准思维让我这样想： “朋友，这些不幸只会 让你的成功经历更酷一些。”

I used this as fuel to the fire, motivation, if you will. It made me think, you know, life is just a book. Not every chapter is going to be perfect. But it's about how it ends.
我把这当作是一种力量， 也可以说是生活的动力。 它让我想到， 生活就像是一本书。 不是每一章都是完美的。 但重要的是，书的结尾是什么。

Which brings me to the second step of the Hi Level mindset. Always be intentional with your desires. Know exactly what you want. In 2018, I created a vision board -- at the beginning of 2018, excuse me -- I created a vision board. And I'm proud to say that with the Hi Level mindset, within one year I almost accomplished everything on here. Ya’ll can clap for that.
这引出了我要讲的 高水准思维的第二步。 要有意识地去实现自己的愿望。 知道你到底想要什么。 2018 年，我做了一块愿景板—— 抱歉，是在 2018 年初， 我做了一块愿景板。 可以自豪地说，利用高水准思维， 我在一年内几乎实现了 板子上的所有愿望。 此处应该有掌声。

So I encourage you to just write down your goals. Starting off your day with reading your goals and dreams aloud gives you a boost of positive energy. This energy can be transmuted into something we call faith. Faith in your ability, faith in yourself, faith in a higher power will take you to places you can't even imagine. Know exactly what you want. How can you be Hi Level if you don't know what Hi Level is to you?
因此，我鼓励大家 写下自己的目标。 每天一大早， 都大声朗读自己的目标和梦想， 为自己带来满满的正能量。 这种能量可以转化为某种东西， 我们称之为信仰。 相信你的能力，相信你自己， 更坚定的信仰 将引领你到达无法想像的高度。 知道你到底想要什么。 如果你都不知道你的高水准是什么， 又怎么能达到高水准呢？

And in order to do all these things, it brings me to the third step of the Hi Level mindset. Discipline. Growing up, discipline was always taught in such a lame way that I always tried my best to avoid it.
为了做到这些， 这就引出了我要讲的 高水准思维的第三步。 自律。 在成长的过程中， 我们一直以蹩脚的方式学习自律， 以至于我总是会设法逃避自律。

But where motivation is low, that's where discipline kicks in. Anybody who's done something noteworthy with their lives all have one thing in common, and that's discipline. Mastering the art of discipline will literally change your life. I witnessed this close hand by studying a friend up close. This friend of mine noticed that every time he stopped doing drugs and alcohol, something good would happen.
但是，只有在缺乏动力的时候， 才需要自律。 任何人如果做出了瞩目的成就， 他们都有一个共同点， 那就是自律。 不夸张地说， 坚持自律会改变你的命运。 我通过近距离观察一个朋友， 亲自见证了这一点。 我的这个朋友注意到， 每次他停止吸毒和饮酒， 都会有好事发生。

He felt as though this was a divine calling from heaven above to halt all his vices. Now can anyone tell me the three main vices of a 19-year-old college student? It's sex, alcohol and drugs. If you all didn't know that already. And after the first six months of him stopping his vices, I seen his whole life change completely. Again he thought this is a sign that maybe God doesn't want me to do drugs, drink alcohol or have sex. But no, that's not the case. Thank you. He was just simply learning discipline without knowing. Alright. I have a confession to make. Because I don't want to make this entire TED Talk about myself, I lied and said that this is a friend.
他觉得这好像是来自天堂 神明的召唤， 要求他停止所有恶习。 现在，有人可以说出 一个 19 岁的大学生的 三个主要恶习吗？ 它们就是滥性、酗酒和吸毒。 如果你们还不知道的话。 在停止这些恶习后的前六个月， 我看到他的整个生活 发生了翻天覆地的变化。 而且，他认为这是一个信号： 可能上帝不希望我吸毒、 饮酒或滥性。 但并不是这样。 谢谢大家！ 他只是不知不觉地学会了自律。 好吧，我要承认一件事。 因为我不想在这整段TED 演讲中一直只讲我自己， 于是我说谎了， 说这是我的一个朋友。

It was actually me.
它实际上说的就是我。

Now a cheat code to ensure that you're staying disciplined to whatever you're striving for is to prime your environment for success. Your habits are based on your habitat. And the main product of your habitat are the people in your life. Which brings me to a very important step of the Hi Level mindset. The fourth step, to be exact. Remove all negative people out of your life immediately. Anybody that's semidoubtful or naysaying, get them out. If you're talking about your dreams and goals and they give small, sarcastic remarks ... boot them.
现在，秘诀就是 确保你在追求任何目标时 都保持自律，以便改善环境， 进而取得成功。 你的习惯与生存环境息息相关。 你生存环境的主要“产品”， 是你生活中的人。 这引出了高水准思维的 一个非常重要的步骤。 也就是第四步。 立即将思想消极的人 从你生命中赶出去。 任何人只要半信半疑或表示反对， 就将他们清理出去。 如果你谈到自己的梦想和目标， 而他们说出贬低、讽刺的话…… 就把他们踢出去。

Just an all-around negative Nancy? Kick them out of there, man. Does anybody in the audience know somebody that's like that? Please raise your hand. I need you all to do me a favor. Pull your phones out and block them immediately.
一个满满负能量的人？ 朋友，把他们踢走。 在座的有人认识那样的人吗？ 请举手。 我需要大家帮我一个忙。 拿出手机，立即把他们拉黑。

No, no, no. I'm dead serious. Don’t let someone else’s negativity cancel out your light, for it can temporarily get in the way of you achieving what's owed to you. You are a product of those who you hang around. Let's make sure we're hanging around other positive, Hi Level individuals.
不，不，我没有开玩笑。 不要让任何负能量的人 熄灭你心中的光， 因为这会暂时阻止 你去实现自己的目标。 近朱者赤，近墨者黑。 我们要确保与其他正能量、 高水准的人呆在一起。

Now I like to consider myself a master at this Hi Level stuff. I mean, I am here for a reason, right?
现在，我认为自己是 高水准思维的大师。 我是说， 我来这里是有原因的，是吧？

But that doesn't mean things always go my way. Even now, I just recently released my sophomore album "From a Birds Eye View" that I spent two full years creating. My debut album, "The Lost Boy," was met with massive critical acclaim and success, and I had a lot of pressure on myself, to outdo myself. And in my eyes and in the eyes of many, I did. I had huge expectations for this album, but when it finally released and it wasn't received as well as I'd hoped, I completely broke down. I did my fasting. I stayed positive. I wrote down my dreams and goals. I was disciplined. I was doing this every day to make sure that this big moment that it was leading up to, that would change the entire world, would go perfectly. But that didn't happen. I did not meet the expectations that I had set for myself, that the world had set for me. And this is the first time as a major artist that I had received mixed reviews of my art. And again, it broke me down, man. I became unmotivated, I started overindulging in things that I'm not proud of. I was almost thinking about canceling my upcoming tour. I was in a very dark place.
但是，那并不表示 我做什么事情都会顺利。 即使是现在， 我刚刚发行了我的第二张专辑， 《From a Bird’s Eye View》， 我花了整整两年制作的专辑。 我的首张专辑《The Lost Boy》 受到了广泛好评， 取得了巨大成功， 我给了自己很大压力， 想要超越自己。 在我看来，在许多人看来， 我做到了。 我对这张专辑抱有非常大的期望， 但当它最终发行时， 它并没获得我期待的好评。 我完全崩溃了。 我节食。我积极乐观。 我写下自己的梦想和目标。 我保持自律。 每一天，我都努力确保 实现这个重大目标， 那会改变整个世界，实现圆满。 但那并没有成真。 我没有满足我为自己设定的期待， 世界对我的期待。 作为知名歌手，这是第一次 人们对我的作品褒贬不一。 这又一次让我崩溃了。 我失去了动力， 我开始过于沉溺于 那些并不光彩的事情。 我差点决定取消即将开始的巡演。 我的世界一片漆黑。

But then I heard this Yiddish proverb that A$AP Rocky actually told me about at a most important time, and I’m sure he didn’t even know it. It’s “We plan, and God laughs.” And that made me think. The Hi Level mindset is not a recipe for perfection but a commitment to honoring your potential and what you have to offer the world. Don't let your small failures make you lose sight of your bigger picture.
然后，我听到了这句犹太谚语， 实际上，它是A$AP Rocky 在一个非常重要的时刻告诉我的， 我相信他也不清楚这一点。 它就是“人算不如天算”。 那让我陷入了思考。 高水准思维不是完美的秘诀， 而是一种承诺， 你必须尊重自己的潜能， 对世界有所贡献。 不要因为小小的失败 而丢失更长远的目标。

I'll leave you all with this. We only have one life to live. 110 years maximum if you are a health guru and you have great health insurance.
这就是我想说的。 我们只有一次生命。 即使你是健康达人， 买了全套医疗保险， 你最多也只能活 110 岁。

How are you going to maximize your time on this Earth? Do you want your name to be remembered long after you're gone? The Hi Level mindset is about doing everything that you put your hands on at the highest level that you're capable of doing. Think of your life as a book. Again, each chapter isn't going to be perfect. But how do you want your story to end? In anguish? A bunch of what-ifs? Or leaving a legacy? I choose legacy. The Hi Level way. Thank you.
你如何充实地过完这一生呢？ 你希望在你死后很长时间， 人们仍记得你的名字吗？ 高水准思维的核心， 是以最高水准、 尽最大努力去做每一件事情。 把你的生活看作一本书。 当然，每一章都并不完美。 但是，你希望你的故事如何结束呢？ 是痛苦不堪？ 满怀遗憾？ 还是留下遗产？ 我选择留下遗产。 以高水准的方式过完一生。 谢谢大家！
